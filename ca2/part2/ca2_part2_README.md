### Requirements

1. Create a new branch in your repository named tut-basic-gradle.
2. Start a new gradle spring boot project with the following dependencies: Rest Repositories, Thymeleaf, JPA and H2.
3. Extract the generated zip file into the folder "CA2/part2" of your repository. Then, check  the available gradle tasks.
4. Delete the src folder, and copy the src folder from the basic folder of the tutorial into the new folder.
   a. Copy the files webpack.config.js and package.json;
   b. Delete the folder src/main/resources/static/built/;
5. Add the gradle plugin org.siouan.frontend to the project.
6. Add "org.siouan.frontend-jdk17" version "8.0.0"
7. Configure the plugin in build.gradle.
8. Update the scripts section in package.json to configure the execution of webpack.
9. Add a task to gradle to copy the generated jar.
10. Add a task to gradle to delete all the files generated by webpack.

### Analysis

1. Create a new branch in your repository named tut-basic-gradle. This action pertains to managing version control via Git. 
   * It serves to segregate alterations made during the migration procedure, thereby safeguarding the primary branch of the project from any potential impact.


2. Start a new gradle spring boot project with the following dependencies: Rest Repositories, Thymeleaf, JPA and H2. This task entails setting up a new Spring Boot project utilizing Gradle as the build tool.
   * These designated dependencies facilitate the development of RESTful APIs, the rendering of server-side HTML views, data persistence through the Java Persistence API (JPA), and utilize H2 as an in-memory database.


3. Unzip the generated file and transfer its contents into the directory "CA2/part2" within your repository. Subsequently, examine the assortment of Gradle tasks accessible.

   * This procedure encompasses unpacking the project files from the provided zip archive and assessing the spectrum of Gradle tasks at your disposal. Such examination aids in comprehending the build sequence within the new Gradle project.
  
 
4. Erase the "src" directory, then duplicate the "src" folder from the basic tutorial folder into the newly emptied directory.

9. **Task Addition**: Introduce a new Gradle task responsible for copying the generated JAR file to a designated location. This task streamlines the deployment and distribution process, enhancing efficiency and organization.

10. **Cleanup Task Addition**: Implement a Gradle task designed to remove all files generated by webpack. This task promotes a clean and consistent build environment, minimizing potential conflicts or errors during subsequent builds.

### Implementation

Let's start by implementing the requirements for converting the basic version of the Tutorial application to Gradle. We will follow the steps outlined in the requirements and provide a detailed explanation for each step.

1. Create a new branch in your repository named tut-basic-gradle.

```bash
git branch tut-basic-gradle
git checkout tut-basic-gradle
```

2. Start a new Gradle Spring Boot project with the specified dependencies. Use https://start.spring.io/ to generate the project with the following dependencies:
* Rest Repositories
* Thymeleaf
* JPA
* H2

3. Extract the generated zip file into the folder "CA2/part2" of your repository. Then, check the available Gradle tasks.

* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "#17 added extracted demo.zip to ca2/part2/"
git push origin tut-basic-gradle
```

4. Check the available gradle tasks:

```bash
./gradlew tasks
```

5. Delete the src folder.

```bash
cd CA2/part2
rm -r src
```

* Commit and push the changes.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "#19 deleted src from ca2/part2/ closes#19"
    git push origin tut-basic-gradle
    ```
  
6. Copy the src folder from the basic folder of the tutorial into the new folder.

```bash
cp -r path/to/basic/src CA2/part2
```

7. Copy the webpack.config.js

```bash
cp ../../ca1/basic/webpack.config.js CA2/part2
```

8. Copy the package.json

```bash
cp ../../ca1/basic/package.json CA2/part2
```

9. Delete the folder src/main/resources/static/built/

```bash
rm -r src/main/resources/static/built
```

* Commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "#20 deleted src folder and copied webpack.config.js and package.json. Deleted build folder closes#20"

	delete 'src/main/resources/static/built/'
}

clean.dependsOn deleteWebpackFiles
```
* Commit and push the changes.
```bash 
git add build.gradle
git commit -m "#26 added task to delete built folder closes#26"
git push origin tut-basic-gradle
```

16. Close the branch and merge to the main branch.

```bash 
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff tut-basic-gradle 
```

17. Mark the repository with the tag ca2-part2.

```bash
git tag ca2-part2
