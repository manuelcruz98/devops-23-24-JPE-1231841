2. Created the .babelrc file:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
  "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"]
}
```

3. Created babel.config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
    presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react'],
    plugins: ['@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties']
};
```

4. Altered my package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "spring-data-rest-and-reactjs",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Demo of ReactJS + Spring Data REST",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git@github.com:spring-guides/tut-react-and-spring-data-rest.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "rest",
    "hateoas",
    "spring",
    "data",
    "react"
  ],

    "webpack": "^5.91.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.4",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^5.0.4"
  }
}
```
5. Altered the webpack.config.js

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/main/js/app.js',
    devtool: 'source-map',
    cache: true,
    mode: 'production', // Or 'production' for optimized builds
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/main/resources/static/built'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
    },
    devServer: {
        hot: true, // Enable hot module replacement
        open: true, // Automatically open the browser
        historyApiFallback: true,

    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                use: {
                    loader: 'babel-loader',
                    options: {
                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }


};
```
6. Added the following jar files:
* h2-2.2.224-jar
* logback-classic-1.5.5.jar
* logback-core-1.5.5.jar
* spring-boot-loader-tools-2.7.18.jar

### Conclusion

In this report, I successfully migrated the Tutorial application from Maven to Ant, following a structured process. I started by creating a new branch and configuring Ant for the project. Next, I replaced Maven-specific configurations with Ant equivalents and set up Ant tasks for building, packaging, and running the application. Additionally, I added tasks to copy the generated JAR and clean up webpack-generated files.

The Gradle build tool is more advanced and provides better support for Java projects. Despite my efforts, I couldn't get the Employees information to be displayed on the frontend. Furthermore, I found that Ant-built projects require more manual configuration compared to Gradle.
