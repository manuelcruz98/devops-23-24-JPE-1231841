# DevOps | Class Assignment 1 - Technical Report

### Part 1 - Adding a new feature using only the master branch.

This technical report documents the steps taken to fulfill the requirements outlined for CA1, which involves setting up
a React.js and Spring Data REST application, adding a new feature, and versioning the application.

1. Copy the code of the Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST Application into a new folder named CA1.
2. Commit the changes (and push them).
3. We should use tags to mark the versions of the application. You should use a
   pattern like: major.minor.revision (e.g., 1.1.0).
   Tag the initial version as v1.1.0. Push it to the server.
4. Lets develop a new feature to add a new field to the application. In this case, lets
   add a new field to record the years of the employee in the company (e.g., jobYears).
    * You should add support for the new field.
    * You should also add unit tests for testing the creation of Employees and the validation
      of their attributes (for instance, no null/empty values). For the new field, only integer
      values should be allowed.
    * You should debug the server and client parts of the solution.
    * When the new feature is completed (and tested) the code should be committed and
      pushed and a new tag should be created (e.g, v1.2.0).
5. At the end of the assignment mark your repository with the tag ca1-part1.

### Analysis

1. **Copy the code to CA1 folder**: The primary goal is to integrate the Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST
   Application code into a new folder named CA1.
2. **Commit and Push Changes**: Commit the changes made during the integration process and push them to the master
   branch.
3. **Versioning with Tags** :Implement versioning for the application using tags, starting with the initial version (
   v1.1.0).
4. **Develop and Test New Feature** :Develop a new feature by adding a 'jobYears' field to the application, implement
   support for it, and conduct thorough testing.
5. **Mark Repository with 'ca1-part1' Tag**: Conclude the assignment by marking the repository with the 'ca1-part1' tag.

### Design

Based on the analysis we can identify the following steps to fulfill the requirements:

- Add a new field to the Employee entity.
- Modify the REST API to support the new field.
- Implement unit tests for creating employees and validating their attributes.
- Identify and fix the issues in both the server and client parts of the solution.
- Commit the changes and create version tags for the initial version and the new feature.

### Setting Up the Project

**Initialize a new Git repository**:

```
    cd CA1
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
```

**Adding gitignore**:

```
touch.gitignore

# Copied gitignore from gitignore.io

git add .

git commit -m "Added .gitignore"
```

#### Implementation

1. Copy the code to CA1 folder using the following command:

```
#Create a new folder named CA1
   mkdir CA1

#Copy code into CA1 folder
   cp -r Tutorial_React_Spring_Data_REST/* CA1/
```

2. Commit the changes and push them to the master branch:

```
# Navigate to CA1 folder
cd CA1/

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "#1 and #2 issues"

# Push changes to the master branch
git push -u origin master
```

3. Versioning with Tags:

```
# Tag the initial version as v1.1.0
git tag v1.1.0

# Push the tag to the server
git push origin v1.1.0
```

4. Develop and Test New Feature:

    - Add a new field 'jobYears' to the Employee entity in the Employee.java file.

```java

public class Employee {


    //Attributes
    private @Id
    @GeneratedValue Long id; // <2>
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String description;
    private int jobYears;

    //Constructor
    public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, String description, int jobYears) {
        setFirstName(firstName);
        setLastName(lastName);
        setDescription(description);
        setJobYears(jobYears);
    }

    //Overrides 
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Employee employee = (Employee) o;
        return Objects.equals(id, employee.id) &&
                Objects.equals(firstName, employee.firstName) &&
                Objects.equals(lastName, employee.lastName) &&
                Objects.equals(description, employee.description) &&
                jobYears == employee.jobYears;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {

        return Objects.hash(id, firstName, lastName, description, jobYears);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", firstName='" + firstName + '\'' +
                ", lastName='" + lastName + '\'' +
                ", description='" + description + '\'' +
                ", jobYears=" + jobYears + '\'' +
                '}';
    }

    //Getters and Setters
    public int getJobYears() {
        return jobYears;
    }

    public void setJobYears(int jobYears) {
        if (jobYears < 0)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Job years must be greater than 0.");
        this.jobYears = jobYears;
    }
}
````

- Add a new field 'jobYears' to the DatabaseLoader method

```java

@Component // <1>
public class DatabaseLoader implements CommandLineRunner { // <2>

    @Override
    public void run(String... strings) throws Exception { // <4>
        this.repository.save(new Employee("Frodo", "Baggins", "ring bearer", 4));
    }
}
````

- Modify the REST API to support the new field by adding the necessary annotations to the EmployeeRepository.java file.

```javascript
// tag::employee-list[]
class EmployeeList extends React.Component {
    render() {
        const employees = this.props.employees.map(employee =>
            <Employee key={employee._links.self.href} employee={employee}/>
        );
        return (
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>First Name</th>
                        <th>Last Name</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Job Years</th>
                        <th>Email</th>
                    </tr>
                    {employees}
                </tbody>
            </table>
        )
    }
}

// end::employee-list[]

// tag::employee[]
class Employee extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <tr>
                <td>{this.props.employee.firstName}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.lastName}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.description}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.jobYears}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.email}</td>
            </tr>
        )
    }
}

// end::employee[]


````

- Implement unit tests for creating employees and validating their attributes in the EmployeeRepositoryTests.java file.ยบ

```java

- Running the app and debuging the server and client parts of the solution:

```bash
# Run the app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- Accessing the app at http://localhost:8080/ and checking the new feature:
  ![img_1.png](img_1.png)

- Commit the changes and create a new tag for the new feature:

```
# Add and commit changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "#1 and #2 issues"

//added untrackedfiles 
# Tag the new feature as v1.2.0
git tag v1.2.0

# Push the tag to the server
git push origin v1.2.0

# Mark the repository with the 'ca1-part1' tag
git tag ca1-part1

# Push the tag to the server
git push origin ca1-part1
```

### Conclusion

This technical report has documented the steps taken to fulfill the requirements outlined for CA1, which involved
setting up a React.js and Spring Data REST application, adding a new feature, and versioning the application. The new
feature involved adding a 'jobYears' field to the application, implementing support for it, and conducting thorough
testing. The server and client parts of the solution were debugged, and the changes were committed and tagged. The
repository was marked with the 'ca1-part1' tag to conclude the assignment.

### Part 2 - Implementing a simple scenario illustrating a simple git workflow using branches.

This technical report outlines the steps and decisions made in implementing a simple Git workflow for the second part of
the CA1 assignment. The focus is on branching, developing new features, fixing bugs, and versioning using Git commands.
The tutorial-style format ensures easy reproducibility by following the provided instructions.

1. You should use the master branch to โpublishโ the โstableโ versions of the Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST
   Application.
2. You should develop new features in branches named after the feature. Create a
   branch named โemail-fieldโ to add a new email field to the application.

- You should create a branch called email-field.
- You should add support for the email field.
- You should also add unit tests for testing the creation of Employees and the validation of their attributes (for
  instance, no null/empty values).
- You should debug the server and client parts of the solution.
- When the new feature is completed (and tested) the code should be merged with the
  master and a new tag should be created (e.g, v1.3.0).

3. You should also create branches for fixing bugs (e.g., โfix-invalid-emailโ):

- Create a branch called fix-invalid-email. The server should only accept Employees with a valid email (e.g., an email
  must have the โ@โ sign).
- You should debug the server and client parts of the solution.
- When the fix is completed (and tested) the code should be merged into master and a
  new tag should be created (with a change in the minor number, e.g., v1.3.0 -> v1.3.1)

4. At the end of the assignment mark your repository with the tag "ca1-part2"

### Analysis

1. **Publish Stable Versions**: Use the master branch to publish stable versions of the application.
2. **Develop New Features in Branches**: Create a branch named 'email-field' to add a new email field to the
   application. Add support for the email field, add unit tests, debug the server and client parts of the solution,
   merge the feature with the master, and create a new tag (v1.3.0).
3. **Create Branches for Fixing Bugs**: Create a branch called 'fix-invalid-email' to fix the issue of the server only
   accepting employees with a valid email. Debug the server and client parts of the solution, merge the fix with the
   master, and create a new tag (v1.3.1).
4. **Mark Repository with 'ca1-part2' Tag**: Conclude the assignment by marking the repository with the 'ca1-part2' tag.

### Design

Based on the analysis, the following steps are identified to fulfill the requirements:

- Publish stable versions of the application using the master branch.
- Develop new features in branches named after the feature.
- Create a branch named 'email-field' to add a new email field to the application.
- Add support for the email field, add unit tests, and debug the server and client parts of the solution.
- Merge the feature with the master and create a new tag (v1.3.0).
- Create a branch called 'fix-invalid-email' to fix the issue of the server only accepting employees with a valid email.
- Debug the server and client parts of the solution, merge the fix with the master, and create a new tag (v1.3.1).
- Mark the repository with the 'ca1-part2' tag to conclude the assignment.

### Implementation

1. Publish Stable Versions:

    - Use the master branch to publish stable versions of the application.

```
   # Ensure you are on the master branch
git checkout main

# Confirm you have the latest changes
git pull origin main
```

2. Develop New Features in Branches:

    - Create a branch named 'email-field'.

```
# Create a branch named 'email-field'
git checkout -b email-field
```

- Add support for the email field, add unit tests, and debug the server and client parts of the solution.

```java
   public class Employee {

    //Attributes
    private @Id
    @GeneratedValue Long id; // <2>
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String description;
    private int jobYears;
    private String email;

    //Constructor
    public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, String description, int jobYears, String email) {
        setFirstName(firstName);
        setLastName(lastName);
        setDescription(description);
        setJobYears(jobYears);
        setEmail(email);
    }

    //Overrides
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Employee employee = (Employee) o;
        return Objects.equals(id, employee.id) &&
                Objects.equals(firstName, employee.firstName) &&
                Objects.equals(lastName, employee.lastName) &&
                Objects.equals(description, employee.description) &&
                jobYears == employee.jobYears &&
                Objects.equals(email, employee.email);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {

        return Objects.hash(id, firstName, lastName, description, jobYears, email);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{" +
                "id=" + id +

                ", email=" + email +
                '}';
    }

    //Getters and Setters
    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        if (email == null || email.isEmpty()) {
            this.email = email;
        }
    }
}
````

- Add a new field 'email' to the DatabaseLoader method

```java

@Component // <1>
public class DatabaseLoader implements CommandLineRunner { // <2>

    @Override
    public void run(String... strings) throws Exception { // <4>
        this.repository.save(new Employee("Frodo", "Baggins", "ring bearer", 4, "frodobaggins@hotmail.com"));
    }
}
````

- Modify the REST API to support the new field by adding the necessary annotations to the EmployeeRepository.java file.

```javascript

// tag::employee-list[]
class EmployeeList extends React.Component {
    render() {
        const employees = this.props.employees.map(employee =>
            <Employee key={employee._links.self.href} employee={employee}/>
        );
        return (
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>First Name</th>
                        <th>Last Name</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                        <th>Job Years</th>
                        <th>Email</th>
                    </tr>
                    {employees}
                </tbody>
            </table>
        )
    }
}

// end::employee-list[]

// tag::employee[]
class Employee extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <tr>
                <td>{this.props.employee.firstName}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.lastName}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.description}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.jobYears}</td>
                <td>{this.props.employee.email}</td>
            </tr>
        )
    }
}

// end::employee[]
````

- Implement unit tests for creating employees and validating their attributes in the EmployeeRepositoryTests.java file.

```java
    //Tests 
public class EmployeeTests {

    /**

        String firstName = "Frodo";
        String lastName = "Baggins";
        String description = "ring bearer";
        int jobYears = 4;
        String email = "frodobaggins@hotmail.com";


        //Act
        Employee employee = new Employee(firstName, lastName, description, jobYears, email);

        //Assert
        assertNotNull(employee);
    }

    /**
     * Test of Employee getters, of class Employee.
     */
    @Test
    public void testEmployeeGetters() {
        //Arrange

````

- Merge the feature with the master and create a new tag (v1.3.0):

```
# Commit the changes
git commit -m "#4 - Added tests to email field validation"

# Switch to the master branch
git checkout main

# Merge the 'email-field' branch with the master
git merge email-field

# Tag the new feature as v1.3.0
git tag v1.3.0

# Push the tag to the server
git push origin v1.3.0

````

3. Create Branches for Fixing Bugs:

    - Create a branch called 'fix-invalid-email' to fix the issue of the server only accepting employees with a valid
      email.

```
# Create a branch called 'fix-invalid-email'
git checkout -b fix-invalid-email
```

- Debug the server and client parts of the solution.

```java
public void setEmail(String email) {
    if (email == null || email.isEmpty() || !email.contains("@"))
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input");

    String emailRegex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$";
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(email);

    if (!matcher.matches()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid email format");
    }

    this.email = email;
}
`````

- Run the app and debug the server and client parts of the solution:
    ```bash
    # Run the app
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

- Access the app at http://localhost:8080/ and check the new feature:

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

- Merge the fix with the master and create a new tag (v1.3.1):

```
# Commit the changes
git commit -m "#5 - Fix invalid email and respective tests"

# Switch to the master branch
git checkout main

# Merge the 'fix-invalid-email' branch with the master
git merge fix-invalid-email

# Tag the fix as v1.3.1
git tag v1.3.1

# Push the tag to the server
git push origin v1.3.1

# Mark the repository with the 'ca1-part2' tag
git tag ca1-part2

# Push the tag to the server
git push origin ca1-part2
